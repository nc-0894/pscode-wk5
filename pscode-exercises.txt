// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
ask yes or no if the number can be divided by 2
if yes, print on the screen "The number is even."
if no, print on the screen "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


a) Enter the first number and save it as a variable named "number1". Enter the second number and save it as a variable named "number2". Enter the third number and save it as a variable named "number3". Enter the fourth number and save it as a variable named "number4". Enter the fifth number and save it as a variable named "number5".
b) Calculate the sum of all the numbers: sum = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5. Then divide the sum by 5 to calculate the average: average = sum / 5. 
    Save a variable for the "average".
c) Enter a variable named "minimum" and set the value to "number1". Enter a variable named "maximum" and set the value to "number1". 
    Go through each of the numbers one by one (starting from the second number).
    Compare each of the remaining numbers (number2 to number5) with the value in the "minimum" variable.
        If the current number is smaller than the value in the "minimum" variable, update the value in the "minimum" variable to be the current number.
    Compare each of the remaining numbers (number2 to number5) with the value in the "maximum" variable.
        If the current number is larger than the value in the "maximum" variable, update the value in the "maximum" variable to be the current number.
    Save a variable for the result for minimum as "minimum". Save a variable for the results for maximum as "maximum".
d) step b
    Print a message "The average of the 5 numbers is [average]" 
        where [average] is the value stored in the "average" variable.
   step c
    Print a message "The smallest number is [minimum] and the largest number is [maximum]".
    where [minimum] is the value stored in the "minimum" variable and [maximum] is the value stored in the "maximum" variable.
